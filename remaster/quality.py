"""Reference-free quality scores per clip, from Meta's Audiobox Aesthetics predictor.

Four axes on a 1 to 10 scale: content enjoyment (ce), content usefulness (cu), production
complexity (pc), production quality (pq). A slider that keeps working music should hold
ce and pq roughly flat as it moves; a slider that wrecks the clip shows up as a drop.
